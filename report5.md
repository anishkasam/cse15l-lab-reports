# Lab Report 5

The lab report that I enjoyed the most was the Week 7 Lab: CLDQ - CSE Labs "Done Quick". I enjoyed it because I was able to get one of the fastest times in the class. Additionally, it was fun competing with the other students.

### How I did the task

After the basic setup steps to do the task, I was able to complete the task very fast by storing the URL of the GitHub repository in my clipboard. After that, I was able to run the commands to run the tests on the code by storing them in my terminal history. After that, I edited the code file quickly by spamming my down arrow key, and using the keyboard shortcuts to save my changes to the file. I ran the tests again through the saved commands in my terminal history. Finally, I was able to quickly commit and push my changes to GitHub by typing fast.
